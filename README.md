GmiMetfieldProcessing
=====================

See the file RunG5Processing.run for information and examples on how to set up your system environment. This could be tricky.

See the file main.config.in. You will have to set each option. Do not add or delete any lines from this file. The RUN_DIR should be the root of your installation - don't try to use another directory. Please see GmiProcessG5DasDiscover.py for a complete description of these options. Read this section carefully.

This set of scripts is best run from a single multi-core node.
